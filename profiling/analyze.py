"""Derive every reported number from ``results/*.json`` and write ``results/analysis.json``.

This is the only place where derived quantities are computed. The report, the dashboard and
the slides read ``results/analysis.json``; none of them recompute anything and none of them
carry a literal measurement. If a number appears in the deliverables it can be traced back
through this file to a field of a run record, or it is a bug.

What it derives
---------------

**A refined wall-clock decomposition.** The metrics contract attributes wall clock to
``submit_to_running_s``, ``image_pull_s``, ``model_load_s``, ``compile_s``,
``steady_state_s``, ``checkpoint_write_s`` and the residual ``other_s``. That is enough to
show where a job spends its time but not enough to answer *how much of the run was the
arithmetic*, because ``steady_state_s`` is defined as ``sum(steps[1:])`` and therefore still
contains the second step — which on every accelerator record here is a second XLA compile —
plus the long tail steps at epoch and checkpoint boundaries. This module splits
``steady_state_s`` further, exactly and without remainder (see :func:`decompose`).

**An amortisation model.** A run costs ``fixed_s + N * median_step_s``. Both terms come from
the record: ``median_step_s`` is measured, and ``fixed_s`` is whatever the wall clock has left
after ``n_steps * median_step_s``. The model is what separates the per-step speedup from the
end-to-end speedup, and the distance between those two numbers is this project's finding.

**Sweep boundaries, the mitigation delta, and cost.** All three by pairing records on their
``config`` blocks rather than by parsing ``run_id`` strings, so a renamed run does not
silently drop out of a comparison.

Usage
-----

::

    python3 profiling/analyze.py                 # writes results/analysis.json
    python3 profiling/analyze.py --print         # ... and prints a readable summary
    python3 profiling/analyze.py --check         # validate records only, write nothing

Standard library only, so it runs anywhere the repo is checked out. ``make_dashboard.py`` is
the one piece of tooling that needs matplotlib.

shape on both axes that matter here — 32 vCPUs and ~29 GB of RAM against 32 logical CPUs and
31 GiB. us-central1 is quoted because Google does not publish a scrapeable us-west4 N1 rate;
N1 pricing between the two regions differs by a few percent.

The CPU cost figures are therefore an estimate with a stated substitution, not a measurement.
They are reported because the comparison is robust to the substitution: see

the ordering changes.

It is reported because the comparison it supports survives the whole published range: an
eight-chip v5e slice lists at 8 x $1.20 = $9.60/hour, so a single GH200 delivering the same
